# README Previewer

A tool to preview README files in Markdown.

## Usage

Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following content:

```json
{
    "relativeDocsPath": "<relative-path-to-your-docs-directory>",
    "port": 5173
}
```

---

Ensure you have the latest Node.js installed and run the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

It will automatically reload the preview when changes are detected.
